## CretinLawk-CLI

CretinLawk is a personal project to solve a personal need, Have a secure way of generating and storing my passwords for various sites and services. While there are already many professional option available, Im both broke and interested in the workings of the code. With that thought process I began working on CretinLawk, With this being the first step to a web app. The project itself is not 100% secure but I plan to use it as a testing ground for future security options.

## Installation

Firstly you will need to have node installed onto you system if you do not already. To install Node please click [Here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
You can check your windows system to see if node is installed by:
- Opening your Windows terminal
- Typing the command "node -v"
- If Node is installed on your system, Your terminal will respond with your node version (Ex:v16.14.2)
- If Node is NOT installed on your system, Your terminal will respond with "node not recognized"

Secondly,
- Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the application too
- open the folder's path in your terminal (Right click on the folder, and select "Open in terminal" option)
- type the command "npm i" to install this applications dependencies if it is your first time using this application

Finally, If the application's dependencies have been installed, 
- type the command "npm start" to begin the application
- Follow the on-screen instructions for further usage.

## Usage

Upon starting the application the user will be asked to select which user to log in as or will prompted to set up their initial user profile.
- It is extremely important that a user remembers their master password. If this is forgotten, Nothing can be done by anyone (to my knowledge) to recover lost passwords.

Once logged in the user will be given the option to either create a new password, display their passwords, update their passwords or delete a password of their choice.

The only other options available at the main menu are too change user profiles or to exit the application.
